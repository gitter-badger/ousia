# TODO
I have the intention of making Ousia an industry-strength language. The main features of Ousia will be:

- Concurrent by default
- Many target platforms. Those which interest me the most are WebAssembly, native binaries, bytecode (for interpretation), JVM
- Speed compilation
- REPL
- APIs first. The language should make it easy for library writes to create
  wondeful and easy APIs.
- DSL support
- Large standard library
